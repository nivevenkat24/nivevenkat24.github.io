overview:
Built an end-to-end pipeline using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Compared logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks to predict churn and explain drivers.

**Findings**
- Compared classic ML (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) vs Deep Learning (ANN).
- Identified key churn drivers to help target retention campaigns.

**The Problem**
Subscription businesses need to identify at-risk customers early, but most rely on manual analysis or non-predictive dashboards. Telecom companies lose millions annually from preventable churn.

stack:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (ANN model)
- Power BI (visualization)
- AI Studio for experimentation

challenges:
- Handling categorical variables (one-hot encoding)
- Preventing data leakage during scaling
- Balancing interpretability (logistic regression) vs performance (RF/ANN)
- Visualizing churn drivers clearly for stakeholders
- Class imbalance
- ANN risk of overfitting

learned:
- How to build ML pipelines end-to-end
- How to compare classic ML vs neural networks
- How feature engineering impacts model outcomes
- How to turn model results into business insights
- ML vs DL tradeoffs
