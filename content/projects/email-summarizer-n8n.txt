### **Overview**
Fully automated email intelligence agent that reads the top 50 emails each week, extracts themes, action items, and reminders, and sends a structured summary to the user.

---

### **Problem**
Professionals spend hours triaging inboxes, often missing critical to-dos hidden inside long threads. A lightweight, automated summarizer reduces cognitive load and improves task prioritization.
