### **Overview**
Developed a pricing and market-entry strategy for hemp-based carbon credits offered by Tao Climate—a climate-tech startup in the XPRIZE Top 100 for carbon removal.

---

### **Problem**
Airlines must decarbonize but face cost pressure and uncertainty around voluntary carbon markets. Tao Climate needed to price hemp-based credits competitively while differentiating from DAC, enhanced weathering, BECCS, and biochar.

### **Tech Stack**
- Excel and Python pricing model  
- Industry benchmarking (Climeworks, Charm, Puro.earth, Nori, Vesta)  
- Airline sustainability reports (SBTi, SAF disclosures)  
- Market sizing and segmentation frameworks

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Inconsistent carbon credit quality and verification  
- VCM price volatility ($15 → $800 depending on methodology)  
- Mapping airline sustainability maturity models  
- Identifying willingness to pay for nature-based vs engineered credits
