overview:
Developed a pricing and market-entry strategy for hemp-based carbon credits offered by Tao Climate — a climate-tech startup in the XPRIZE Top 100 for carbon removal.

problem:
**The Problem**
Airlines must decarbonize but face cost pressure and uncertainty around voluntary carbon markets (VCMs). Tao Climate needed to price hemp-based credits competitively while differentiating from DAC, enhanced weathering, BECCS, and biochar.

stack:
- Excel & Python pricing model
- Industry benchmarking (Climeworks, Charm, Puro.earth, Nori, Vesta)
- Airline sustainability reports (SBTi, SAF disclosures)
- Market sizing & segmentation frameworks

challenges:
- Highly inconsistent carbon credit quality & verification
- VCM price volatility ($15 → $800 depending on methodology)
- Mapping airline sustainability maturity models
- Identifying WTP for nature-based vs engineered credits

learned:
- How to build a defensible pricing model for an emerging market
- How buyers evaluate carbon credits (durability, MRV, co-benefits)
- How to position a niche product in a highly skeptical market
- How to design market segmentation for enterprise buyers
