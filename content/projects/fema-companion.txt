### **Overview**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation tool that makes **FEMA P-750** and **NIST GCR 2016** seismic design guidelines fully searchable. Engineers can ask natural-language questions and receive precise, citation-backed answers.

---

### **Problem**
Seismic codes are dense, technical, and difficult to navigate. Engineers spend time manually searching hundreds of pages and often miss important clauses. There was no fast, authoritative, clause-level lookup grounded directly in source documents.

### **Tech Stack**
- LangChain  
- ChromaDB  
- OpenAI embeddings  
- GPT models  
- Python / Streamlit  
- PDF parsing with `pypdf`

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Designing chunk sizes for technical engineering text  
- Preventing LLM hallucinations with strict grounding constraints  
- Ensuring consistent citation mapping  
- Handling mixed-format engineering documents

---

### **What I Learned**
- How to build a complete RAG system end to end  
- How retrieval quality affects answer accuracy and trustworthiness  
- How to design usable AI tools for domain experts  
- How to enforce accuracy and grounding in engineering workflows
