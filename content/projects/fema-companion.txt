overview: A specialized AI tool to help engineers quickly interpret FEMA P-750 and NIST GCR seismic design guidelines. Users can ask natural-language questions (e.g., “What are the criteria for Seismic Design Category D?”) and receive concise, cited explanations from the official design documents. Built with embeddings, vector retrieval, and a Streamlit UI.
stack:
- PDF text extraction and cleaning
- OpenAI embeddings for semantic encoding
- ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
- GPT-based answer synthesis with citations
- Streamlit user interface
focus:
- Accessibility: Converts static PDFs into a searchable knowledge base
- Accuracy: Answers cite the original code sections
- Efficiency: Reduces time searching manuals by 80%+
target_users:
- Structural engineers referencing FEMA/NIST design codes
- Civil engineers and design reviewers
- Engineering students learning seismic design fundamentals
impact:
- Cuts reference lookup from hours to seconds
- Encourages code compliance via cited answers
- Demonstrates practical AI for engineering knowledge
