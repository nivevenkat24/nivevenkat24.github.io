overview: 
### *Overview*

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that makes 
**FEMA P-750** and **NIST GCR 2016** seismic design guidelines fully searchable. The system enables engineers to ask natural-language questions and receive precise, citation-backed answers.

### **Problem**

Seismic codes are dense, technical, and difficult to navigate. 
Engineers spend significant time manually searching hundreds of pages, often missing important clauses. No existing solution provides fast, authoritative, clause-level lookup grounded directly in source documents.
