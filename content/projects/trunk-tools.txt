overview:
A strategic analysis of Trunk Tools, an AI-native construction startup building vertical LLM models for field productivity. The project evaluated Trunk’s market fit, competitive landscape, workflow integration, and generated a roadmap for product, GTM, and data moat expansion.

problem:
**The Problem**
Construction is a $16.4T industry with chronic productivity issues, fragmented workflows, and labor shortages. Teams lose hours searching documentation, reviewing submittals, and coordinating schedules. Traditional construction software is not AI-native and fails to serve field workers effectively.

    Docs[Construction Docs: RFIs, Specs, Drawings, Schedules] --> ETL[Document Intelligence Pipeline]
    ETL --> VertLLM[Vertical LLM (Construction-trained)]
    VertLLM --> Agents[AI Agents: TrunkText / TrunkSubmittal / TrunkSchedule]

    Agents --> PM[Project Manager Dashboard]

stack:
- Construction-specific LLMs
- Vision + Document Parsing (OCR, PDF parsers)
- Embeddings over drawings, RFIs, submittals
- ETL pipeline for schedules & documents
- Mobile-first UX
- Integrations: Procore, Autodesk, Bluebeam

challenges:
- Understanding workflow reality of jobsite teams
- Mapping each AI agent to a measurable ROI metric
- Evaluating PMF in a highly fragmented industry
- Benchmarking Trunk against Procore, Autodesk, OpenSpace
- Identifying markets for expansion (Canada, UK, Australia)

learned:
- How vertical LLMs outperform general-purpose LLMs in industry use cases
- How to build a product & market segmentation strategy
- How AI can replace documentation work, not workers
- How to think like a PM building for safety-critical environments
- How to structure a GTM plan for an enterprise AI startup
