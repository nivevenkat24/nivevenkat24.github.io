### **Overview**
Strategic analysis of Trunk Tools, an AI-native construction startup building vertical LLM models for field productivity. Evaluated market fit, competitive landscape, workflow integration, and produced a roadmap for product, GTM, and data moat expansion.

---

### **Problem**
Construction is a $16.4T industry with chronic productivity issues, fragmented workflows, and labor shortages. Teams lose hours searching documentation, reviewing submittals, and coordinating schedules. Traditional construction software is not AI-native and fails to serve field workers effectively.

### **Tech Stack**
- Construction-specific LLMs  
- Vision + document parsing (OCR, PDF parsers)  
- Embeddings over drawings, RFIs, submittals  
- ETL pipeline for schedules and documents  
- Mobile-first UX  
- Integrations: Procore, Autodesk, Bluebeam

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Understanding workflow reality of jobsite teams  
- Mapping each AI agent to measurable ROI metrics  
- Evaluating PMF in a highly fragmented industry  
- Benchmarking Trunk against Procore, Autodesk, OpenSpace  
- Identifying markets for expansion (Canada, UK, Australia)

### **What I Learned**
- How vertical LLMs outperform general-purpose LLMs in industry use cases  
- How to build a product and market segmentation strategy  
- How AI can replace documentation work, not workers  
- How to think like a PM building for safety-critical environments  
- How to structure a GTM plan for an enterprise AI startup
