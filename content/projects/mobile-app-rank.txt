### **Overview**
Built statistical models to identify key drivers of mobile app rank across Apple and Google stores. Used Negative Binomial Regression and log-log models to estimate how price, ratings, file size, screenshots, and monetization features impact app demand.

---

### **Problem**
App developers struggle to understand which attributes actually influence store ranking and downloads. With thousands of competing apps, knowing which levers move rank is critical for optimizing visibility and revenue.

### **Tech Stack**
- STATA (nbreg, log-log regression, device segmentation)  
- Excel (initial cleaning and summaries)  
- Elasticity modeling  
- Market segmentation (Apple vs Google, US vs China, Tablet vs Smartphone)  
- KPI modeling (rank, downloads, ratings)

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Overdispersed count data requiring NBREG instead of Poisson  
- Significant cross-market elasticity differences (US vs China)  
- Interpreting log-log coefficients as elasticities  
- Complex interaction effects (device type × monetization model)

---

### **What I Learned**
- Pricing hurts Google users but can improve downloads for Apple users  
- File size signals “quality” to Apple users, improving rank  
- Rating count is the strongest universal predictor of app success  
- In-app purchases boost rank on smartphones but not tablets
