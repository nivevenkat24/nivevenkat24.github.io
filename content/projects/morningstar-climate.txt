### **Overview**
Led the market and regulatory analysis for a climate-aligned European equity index. Integrated Morningstar and Sustainalytics ESG datasets to create a forward-looking, regulatory-aligned index methodology.

---

### **Problem**
Existing ESG indexes rely on backward-looking emissions and opaque scoring. Investors want transparent, forward-looking climate indexes aligned to EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and TCFD standards.

### **Tech Stack**
- Morningstar Direct  
- Sustainalytics ESG data  
- Python for scoring and weighting  
- EU Taxonomy, SFDR, CSRD regulatory frameworks

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Missing Scope 3 data  
- Inconsistent TCFD reporting  
- Designing methodology that is both investable and climate-aligned  
- Balancing large-cap dominance vs mid/small cap representation  
- Avoiding greenwashing

### **What I Learned**
- How ESG index construction works behind the scenes  
- How climate regulations directly shape financial products  
- How to design transparent scoring methodologies  
- How forward-looking metrics outperform pure emissions data
