overview:
Led the Market & Regulatory Analysis for a climate-aligned European equity index. The project integrated Morningstar + Sustainalytics ESG datasets to create a forward-looking, regulatory-aligned index methodology.

problem:
**The Problem**
Existing ESG indexes rely on backward-looking emissions and opaque scoring. Investors want transparent, forward-looking climate indexes, aligned to EU Taxonomy, SFDR, and TCFD standards.

stack:
- Morningstar Direct
- Sustainalytics ESG data
- Python for scoring & weighting
- EU Taxonomy, SFDR, CSRD regulatory frameworks

challenges:
- Missing Scope 3 data
- Inconsistent TCFD reporting
- Designing methodology that is both investable & climate-aligned
- Balancing large-cap dominance vs mid/small cap representation
- Avoiding greenwashing

learned:
- How ESG index construction works behind the scenes
- How climate regulations directly shape financial products
- How to design transparent scoring methodologies
- How forward-looking metrics outperform pure emissions data
