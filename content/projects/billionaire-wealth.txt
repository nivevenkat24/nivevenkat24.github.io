### **Overview**
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing billionaire demographics, wealth distribution, and economic indicators using a global dataset. The visual story highlights industry dominance, age and gender patterns, and economic relationships across GDP, CPI, tax rates, and billionaire concentration.

---

### **Problem**
Policymakers and business analysts struggle to understand how billionaire wealth evolves across industries, countries, and economic conditions. The dataset is large and multi-dimensional, requiring clear visual storytelling to extract trends and support economic insight.

### **Tech Stack**
- Tableau Desktop (multi-chart dashboard design)  
- Tableau Story (narrative insights)  
- Exploratory charts: bar charts, scatter plots, maps, heatmaps  
- KPI segmentation (industry, gender, age, country)  
- Economic correlation analysis (GDP, CPI, tax rates)

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Combining demographic, industry, and economic variables into one narrative  
- Designing intuitive visual comparisons across countries and industries  
- Showing economic correlations without overfitting the visuals  
- Ensuring clarity while integrating dashboards (country, demographics, macro trends)

---

### **What I Learned**
- How to blend demographic and economic indicators in a unified visual story  
- How to apply visual hierarchy to guide users through complex insights  
- How to interpret GDP/CPI relationships using scatter and regression visuals  
- How emerging markets (India, China) shift global billionaire distribution
