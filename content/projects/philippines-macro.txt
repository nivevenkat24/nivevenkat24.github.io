overview:
Performed a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis of the Philippines using 30 years of data from FRED, World Bank, ADB, and trade datasets. Evaluated GDP growth, inflation, exports, productivity, sector composition, labor dynamics, and long-run economic prospects.

problem:
**The Problem**
Emerging markets like the Philippines show rapid yet volatile growth. Investors, governments, and retirement funds need structured, data-driven insights to assess stability, long-term prospects, and key macro risks.

    D --> E[Growth Accounting]
    E --> F[Risk Assessment & Investment Outlook]

stack:
- FRED datasets (GDP, CPI, unemployment, PPP)
- Trade & industry data (Atlas of Economic Complexity)
- Excel (trend charts, time-series analysis)
- Growth accounting framework
- Comparative analysis vs. peer economies
- Macro risk assessment (inflation, demographics, debt)

challenges:
- Large multi-source datasets with differing time ranges
- Distinguishing structural vs. cyclical drivers of growth
- Interpreting conflicting signals (falling fertility vs. rising GDP)
- Connecting population trends to productivity forecasts
- Assessing geopolitical exposure (U.S.–China dynamics)

learned:
- The Philippines’ strongest driver of growth is TFP + labor force expansion
- Remittances (8% of GDP) act as a stabilizing force during downturns
- A booming BPO sector makes the country a “tiger economy”
- Aging population and low capital investment pose long-term risks
- The country’s 20-year growth outlook is strong, with high investor potential
