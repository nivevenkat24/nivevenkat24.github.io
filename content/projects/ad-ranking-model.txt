overview:
Designed regression models to predict ad rank using key auction variables including CTR, bid price, ad quality, landing page quality, retailer/brand presence, and daily effects. Achieved high explanatory power for CTR (Adj. R² = 0.91) and strong improvements in Ad Rank prediction when incorporating date effects.

problem:
**The Problem**
Brands waste ad spend because they don’t know which factors actually improve their paid search ranking. Understanding what drives Google Ad Rank helps optimize bidding, creative, and landing page strategy.

architecture:
flowchart LR
Ad Performance Data → Log Transformations → OLS Model (CTR Drivers) 
→ OLS Model (Ad Rank) → Date Fixed Effects Model → Optimization Strategy

stack:
- STATA (OLS regressions, fixed effects modeling)
- Excel (data prep & summaries)
- CTR & Ad Rank predictive modeling
- Log-transformation for elasticity interpretation
- Model comparison (baseline vs date-adjusted model)

challenges:
- Very strong autocorrelation (lagged CTR dominates predictions)
- Low R² for initial Ad Rank model due to missing time-based factors
- Non-significant variables (ad quality, landing quality) despite theoretical importance
- Identifying daily search competition effects using fixed-effects modeling

learned:
- CTR is primarily driven by past CTR (reinforcement effect)
- Bid price, CTR, brand presence, and retailer names are strong Ad Rank drivers
- Daily variations significantly change Ad Rank, improving model accuracy by +7.5%
- How to translate statistical modeling into actionable paid search recommendations
