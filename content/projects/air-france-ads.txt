### **Overview**
Analyzed Air France’s paid search performance to identify which keywords, campaigns, and landing pages drive clicks, conversions, and revenue. Used CTR–TCR bubble charts and keyword tables to diagnose gaps and optimization opportunities.

### **Problem**
Despite high click-through activity, 94% of searches resulted in zero bookings, revealing a breakdown between ad engagement and conversion. Air France needed data-backed insights to improve landing page performance, keyword ROI, and budget allocation.
