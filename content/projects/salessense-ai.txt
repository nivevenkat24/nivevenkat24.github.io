### **Overview**
AI agent that ingests sales files from shared drives, embeds them into a vector database, and enables conversational analysis of KPIs, performance trends, and competitor insights.

---

### **Problem**
Sales ops teams juggle scattered PDFs, Excel files, and decks. Answering even basic questions about growth or retention requires time-consuming manual work and often yields incomplete insights.
