overview:
Built a Construction Safety AI in Under 1 Hour — Thanks to Antigravity.

**The App**
Upload a construction site photo and instantly see:
🟢 Hardhat / 🔴 No Hardhat
🟢 Safety Vest / 🔴 No Safety Vest
😷 Masks, 🚧 Machinery, 🔶 Cones & more
All detected with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and compliance summaries.

**The Challenge**
I wanted to build an end-to-end construction safety monitoring system that:
📂 Uses a Kaggle dataset of construction site images
🧠 Trains a custom YOLOv8 object detection model
🦺 Detects PPE compliance (hardhats, vests, masks, etc.)
🌐 Runs in a real-time Streamlit web app

stack:
- Antigravity (Google DeepMind)
- Kaggle Dataset
- YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
- Streamlit (Web App)
- Python

**My Take**
If you have ideas but feel limited by your coding skills, Antigravity removes that barrier.
It truly feels like having a world-class developer guiding you end to end.
It’s currently free, incredibly powerful, and honestly… I’m amazed at what’s possible now.
