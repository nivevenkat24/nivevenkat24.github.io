### **Overview**
Built a construction safety AI in under one hour using Antigravity. Upload a construction site photo and instantly see
- 🟢 Hardhat / 🔴 No Hardhat
- 🟢 Safety Vest / 🔴 No Safety Vest
- 😷 Masks
- 🚧 Machinery
- 🔶 Cones and more—each with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and compliance summaries.

### **Problem**
Needed an end-to-end construction safety monitoring system that could  
- 📂 Use a Kaggle dataset of construction site images  
- 🧠 Train a custom YOLOv8 object detection model  
- 🦺 Detect PPE compliance (hardhats, vests, masks, etc.)  
- 🌐 Run in a real-time Streamlit web app

### **Tech Stack**
- Antigravity (Google DeepMind)  
- Kaggle dataset  
- YOLOv8 (object detection)  
- Streamlit (web app)  
- Python

### **What I Learned**
If you have ideas but feel limited by your coding skills, Antigravity removes that barrier. It feels like having a world-class developer guiding you end to end—and it’s currently free and incredibly powerful.
