### **Overview**
Developed a complete luxury perfume brand from concept to market-ready pitch using generative AI and data analytics. Combined strategic market analysis with AI-powered creativity to create a full brand ecosystem.

---

### **The Brand: Verra**
- Tagline: Grounded in Truth
- Positioning: Sustainable minimalist luxury for modern conscious youth
- Product: Verra 01: Rooted — a woody citrus Eau de Parfum ($145)

---

### **Process**
- Identity: Used ChatGPT to generate names and taglines, selecting “Verra” (Truth + Earth).
- Visuals: Created minimalist, embossed logo and packaging concepts using Leonardo.ai.
- Data: Analyzed 2,000 eBay listings to identify the “Affordable Luxury” gap ($43–$54 average).
- Product: Designed the scent profile (Bergamot, Vetiver, Cedarwood) and zero-waste packaging (mushroom mycelium).
- Campaign: Developed the “#MyScentTruth” marketing campaign and pop-up launch strategy.

---

### **Problem**
Traditional luxury fragrance brands lack transparency, while clean beauty brands often sacrifice luxury aesthetics. There was no brand serving the “Byredo for the Eco-Conscious” niche—offering premium design, emotional storytelling, and radical sustainability.
