overview:
Developed a complete luxury perfume brand from concept to market-ready pitch using generative AI and data analytics. The project combined strategic market analysis with AI-powered creativity to create a full brand ecosystem.

**The Brand: Verra**
*Tagline*: Grounded in Truth
*Positioning*: Sustainable Minimalist Luxury for Modern Conscious Youth
*Product*: Verra 01: Rooted — A woody citrus Eau de Parfum ($145)

**Process**
1. **Identity**: Used ChatGPT to generate names and taglines, selecting "Verra" (Truth + Earth).
2. **Visuals**: Created a minimalist, embossed logo and packaging concepts using Leonardo.ai.
3. **Data**: Analyzed 2,000 eBay listings to identify the "Affordable Luxury" gap ($43-$54 avg).
4. **Product**: Designed the scent profile (Bergamot, Vetiver, Cedarwood) and zero-waste packaging (Mushroom mycelium).
5. **Campaign**: Developed the "#MyScentTruth" marketing campaign and pop-up launch strategy.

**The Problem**
Traditional luxury fragrance brands lack transparency, while clean beauty brands often sacrifice luxury aesthetics. There was no brand serving the "Byredo for the Eco-Conscious" niche—offering premium design, emotional storytelling, and radical sustainability.
