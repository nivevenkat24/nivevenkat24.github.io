### **Overview**
Built SubmittalCheck AI—an AI-powered submittal reviewer that reads PDFs, checks completeness, flags spec deviations, and drafts engineer-ready comments using Google AI Studio and Gemini Pro 3.

---

### **Problem**
Submittal reviews are slow, manual, and error-prone. Engineers spend hours scanning specs, drawings, cut sheets, and certifications, and often miss attachments or conflicting details. Most AEC teams lack a lightweight tool that automates extraction, completeness checks, compliance review, and draft comments.

---

### **Solution**
AI reviewer that handles the tedious parts in seconds:  
- Upload PDF: Reads text, tables, scanned pages, cut sheets  
- Analyze: Extracts submittal number, spec section, product, model; checks for missing certificates/calcs; performs spec compliance and deviation checks  
- Draft Response: Generates engineer-ready comments and recommended status (Approved / Approved as Noted / Revise & Resubmit / Rejected)  
- Auto-logs everything into Google Docs and Sheets

---

### **Tech Stack**
- Gemini Pro 3.0  
- Google AI Studio  
- Google Extensions (Docs + Sheets)  
- Google PDF/Document Processing  
- React + Tailwind (UI)

### **What I Learned**
The breakthrough wasn’t PDF parsing—it was giving the AI agentic capabilities. With Google Search Grounding and external tool calls, the AI can verify details like a junior engineer: “Is this model discontinued?” “What’s the latest ASTM standard?” “Does this product match the spec?” We’re moving from “AI as a wrapper” to “AI as an agent.”
