overview:
Today I built SubmittalCheck AI, an AI-powered submittal reviewer that reads PDFs, checks completeness, flags spec deviations, and drafts engineer-ready comments — all using Google AI Studio + the brand-new Gemini Pro 3.

**The Solution**
My AI reviewer handles the tedious parts in seconds:
✔️ Upload PDF: Reads text, tables, scanned pages, cut sheets
✔️ Analyze: Extracts submittal number, spec section, product, model; Checks for missing certificates/calcs; Performs spec compliance + deviation checks
✔️ Draft Response: Generates a clean engineer comment + recommended status (Approved / Approved as Noted / Revise & Resubmit / Rejected)
All automatically logged into Google Docs + Sheets.

**The Problem**
Submittal reviews are slow, manual, and error-prone.
Engineers spend hours scanning specs, drawings, cut sheets, and certifications — and it’s easy to miss missing attachments or conflicting details.
Most AEC teams don’t have a lightweight tool that can automate extraction, completeness checks, compliance review, and drafting comments.

stack:
- Gemini Pro 3.0
- Google AI Studio
- Google Extensions (Docs + Sheets)
- Google PDF/Document Processing
- React + Tailwind (UI)

learned:
**My “Aha!” Moment**
The breakthrough wasn’t PDF parsing, it was giving the AI agentic capabilities.
With Google Search Grounding + external tool calls, the AI can now verify details like a junior engineer:
• “Is this model discontinued?”
• “What’s the latest ASTM standard?”
• “Does this product match the spec?”
We're moving from "AI as a wrapper" to "AI as an Agent."
