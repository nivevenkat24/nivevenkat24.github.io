### **Overview**
Analyzed how competitor 2-for-1 pricing impacted Cinemex attendance in Mexico City. Built counterfactuals, time-series graphs, demand curve diagrams, and regressions to quantify lost demand and evaluate Cinemex’s pricing response.

---

### **Problem**
Attendance dropped after competitors launched aggressive Wednesday 2-for-1 pricing. Needed to isolate the causal impact of competitor pricing and decide whether Cinemex should match the promotion.

### **Tech Stack**
- Excel (time-series, percent-change analysis, scenario modeling)  
- Economic modeling (demand curves, substitution effects)  
- Multiple regression (controls for seasonality and city-wide demand)  
- Counterfactual simulation  
- Price elasticity calculations  
- Competitive strategy analysis

---

### **Key Challenges**
- Heavy seasonality in cinema attendance  
- Confounding factors (holidays, heat waves, new releases)  
- Limited 2.5 years of data available  
- High correlation between city-wide and Cinemex attendance  
- Sparse competitor pricing data beyond the 2-for-1 deal

---

### **What I Learned**
- Competitor 2-for-1 pricing reduced Cinemex’s Wednesday attendance by ~22%  
- Cinemex’s own 2-for-1 introduction boosted winter attendance by ~27.5%  
- Cinemex Wednesday demand is highly elastic (ε ≈ 4–6)  
- Counterfactual modeling is crucial for isolating causal impact  
- Matching competitor pricing was strategically the right move
