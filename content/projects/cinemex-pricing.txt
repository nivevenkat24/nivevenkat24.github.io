overview:
Analyzed how 2-for-1 pricing introduced by a competitor impacted Cinemex’s attendance in Mexico City. Built counterfactuals, time-series graphs, demand curve diagrams, and multiple regressions to quantify lost demand and evaluate Cinemex’s eventual pricing response.

problem:
**The Problem**
Cinemex experienced sudden drops in attendance after competitors launched aggressive Wednesday 2-for-1 pricing. The challenge was to isolate the true causal impact of competitor pricing and evaluate whether Cinemex should match the promotion.

stack:
- Excel (time-series, % change analysis, scenario modeling)
- Economic modeling (demand curves, substitution effects)
- Multiple regression (controls for seasonality & city-wide demand)
- Counterfactual simulation
- Price elasticity calculations
- Competitive strategy analysis

challenges:
- Heavy seasonality in cinema attendance
- Confounding factors (holidays, heat waves, new releases)
- Limited 2.5 years of data available
- High correlation between city-wide and Cinemex attendance
- Lack of competitor pricing data beyond the 2-for-1 deal

learned:
- Competitor 2-for-1 pricing reduced Cinemex’s Wednesday attendance by ~22%
- Cinemex’s own 2-for-1 introduction boosted winter attendance by ~27.5%
- Cinemex demand on Wednesdays is highly elastic (ε ≈ 4–6)
- Counterfactual modeling is crucial for isolating causal impact
- Matching competitor pricing was strategically the right move
