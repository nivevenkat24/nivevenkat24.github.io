### **Overview**
Interactive Tableau HR Insights Dashboard covering employee performance, salary distribution, engagement levels, and attrition patterns. Leaders can explore workforce trends and uncover actionable insights for retention and performance management.

### **Problem**
HR teams and senior leadership often lack a unified view of workforce data. Disconnected systems make it difficult to understand turnover, performance gaps, and compensation fairness. This dashboard consolidates critical HR metrics into a single, intuitive interface.
